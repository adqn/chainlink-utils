# chainlink-utils
Some small but useful scripts written during the course of the 1st Chainlink Oracle Olympics. Included are bash scripts for testing and deploying external adapters and a Python script for managing wallet balance. The latter script is incomplete and a bit guessy, but works well enough as a proof of concept.

TODO:
Update proper wallet balance(s) after block confirmations
